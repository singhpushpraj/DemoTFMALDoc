- summary: >-
    A destructive sync mode which makes the resulting schema match the extension in question

    regardless of its starting state. This means no change is off limits. This also means

    that changes which delete things (tables, fields, etc.) also delete the data they contain.

    This mode is intended for use when e.g. renaming tables. It can lead to data loss if used

    without caution.
