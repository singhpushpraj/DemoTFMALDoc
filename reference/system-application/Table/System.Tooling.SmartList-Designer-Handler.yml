summary: >-
  A single-record table that can be used to handle contention between multiple subscribers of the events for the SmartList Designer.

  Consumers of the events should check this record to see if another extension is registered as the handler and then decide if they

  should execute code within their own subscriptions to these events. Likewise, consumers could set this record to register themselves

  as the handler of events.
